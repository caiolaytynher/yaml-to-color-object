# Yaml to color object

This is a project created with make my life easier in mind. The
base purpose is to convert a yaml file into a specific python
object that I've created called `ColorScheme`. It consists of a
dataclass composed of more 3 dataclasses, which are called
`Primary`, `Normal` and `Bright`. This is made to represent the
basic color scheme pattern that most applications use.
